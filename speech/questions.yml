    - question: # Can you tell me more about our mission?
        - answer: <speak>We are transporting the antimatter to Xantonia all in one piece.</speak>
        - answer: <speak>We are on our way to Xantonia to deliver the antimatter.</speak>
    - question: # Have you been to Xantonia before?
        - answer: <speak>No, but I have been on many journeys that were similar.</speak>
        - answer: <speak> No, however, I have been to its solar system before.</speak>
    - question: # What type of ship is this?
        - answer: <speak>The <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈwɛndɪɡoʊ"> Wendigo</phoneme> is a Javelin-class runner. It was produced by the Anvil Aerospace corporation.</speak>
        - answer: <speak>This ship was designed to be versatile in any situation. While the cargo capacity is limited, its speed makes it perfect to transport time sensitive goods.</speak>
    - question: # What is the crews function on this ship?
        - answer: <speak> I am lieutenant <say-as interpret-as="digits">732</say-as>-A. I am in charge of the ships shields, as well as the cooling system and the on-planet drone deployment.</speak>
        - answer: <speak> I am lieutenant <say-as interpret-as="digits">732</say-as>-B. I oversee the ships laser systems, the aerial stabilization system and the oxygen and water recycle module.</speak>

    - question: # Lieutenants, can you tell me more about the solutions?
        - answer: <speak>Our scans show no asteroids that our X<say-as interpret-as="digits">86</say-as>-Twinfire can’t make short work of. The remaining debris should be no problem for our hull.</speak>
        - answer: <speak>Since this is a new ship type with improved Tachyon-shields <break time="0.01s"/> we should be able to deflect even the bigger asteroids without a problem.</speak>
    - question: # How confident are you in these solutions?
        - answer: <speak>I am confident that our X<say-as interpret-as="digits">86</say-as>-Twinfire will be more than enough to disintegrate all incoming projectiles and reduce the threat too</speak>
        - answer: <speak>I have faith that the Tachyon-shields we have equipped are our best option in protecting the hull, the added energy will make us immune to these rocks.</speak>
    - question: # What do you think about each others ideas?
        - answer: <speak>The Tachyon-fields are not a guaranteed defense against asteroid-inflicted damage that exceeds the maximum threshold of shock our hull can endure. </speak>
        - answer: <speak>Since we are flying at a very high speed, the X<say-as interpret-as="digits">86</say-as>-Twinfire might not be able to acquire targets going at the speed of light in the direction of our ship.</speak>

    - question: # Lieutenants, can you tell me more about the solutions?
        - answer: <speak>The advanced quintuple aero-fins can utilize their full air draft manipulation only with additional current manipulation from the engine.</speak>
        - answer: <speak>The beryllium additive in the heat shield needs additional energy or the absorbed heat might not disperse fast enough.</speak>
    - question: # How confident are you in these solutions?
        - answer: <speak>The designers at the Anvil Aerospace corporation make the best advanced quintuple aero-fins <break time="0.01s"/> and I believe in its capabilities.</speak>
        - answer: <speak>The heat shields have a great ability with the beryllium additive to properly protect the ship from the burning heat from re-entry.</speak>
    - question: # What do you think about each others ideas?
        - answer: <speak>After our journey through the asteroid field, we have no knowledge about the integrity of the thrusters.</speak>
        - answer: <speak>There is no point in overcharging the shields if we cannot secure a safe landing.</speak>
- scene: #4
    - question: # Lieutenants, can you tell me more about the solutions?
       - answer: <speak>The detected flora has a striking resemblance to Terra-B<say-as interpret-as="digits">638</say-as>, drones have previously managed to extract the necessary amounts of glycol for the cooling fluid.</speak>
       - answer: <speak>Our models show that reprogramming the water de-vapourizer should not pose a significant challenge. The  gathered gas can be reassembled into the cooling fluid.</speak> 
    - question: # How confident are you in these solutions?
        - answer: <speak> Based on previous experiences, the chemical composition of the plant’s sap will be able to form a cooling fluid for our cooling system.</speak>
        - answer: <speak>It is fully within our capabilities to reprogram the water De-vaporizer to extract cooling fluid from the planet’s air to cool our systems</speak>
    - question: # What do you think about each others ideas?
        - answer: <speak>Repurposing water De-vaporizer is untested and may not provide us with an adequate replacement fluid.</speak>
        - answer: <speak>We do not have sufficient information about  this planet’s wildlife and what lurks outside in this uncharted territory.</speak>
