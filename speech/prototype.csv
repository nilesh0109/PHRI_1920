Speaker, Text
A, "Greetings commander. I am Alex. I am here to help and aid you in your journey to the outpost. Nice to work with you."
B, "Welcome aboard commander! My name is Bob. Pleasure to have you with us on this journey to Xantonia."
A, "We are on our way to Xantonia to deliver the antimatter."
B, "We are flying with a constant speed of four light years toward Xantonia, automatic power saving mode is activated."
S, "Warning! Asteroid field ahead. Unable to perform course change. Defensive actions needed to survive"
B, "Asteroids? Allocating energy reserves to activate phasers would be good. They can shoot down any incoming asteroids and break them into small harmless pieces."
A, "I believe that allocating more power to the shields would be wise, they can keep us safe by simply divert the stones."
S, "Please allocate your resources accordingly and say ok when you are done."
