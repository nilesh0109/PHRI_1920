# Scripts for creating movements. Motion team: Lara, Vadym, Christoper

## Believe movement (preliminary). 
See also a video. Take into consideration that V-REP simulation does not use the 
actual robot (e.g. V-REP simulated NICO has 3 fingers, a real NICO 4). Therefore,
adjustments will be done directly on the robot. But the main movements remain.

## My name movement (preliminary)
See a video. The actual robot has a new wrist than a V-REP simulation. Therefore,
movement will be adjusted directly on a robot.

## Please use Slack channel 'motion' to discuss the movements.
